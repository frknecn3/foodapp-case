//Lastest patch = This utils only using  for margin, padding, fontSize .!!!!!!!!
// Instructions to use:
// 1. Scale is typically used for linear scaling meaning will return  straightforward adjusted scaled value. If you want to preserve the aspect ratio of a shape use this.For eg: Can be used for Images
// 2. Vertical Scale is used for vertical scaling typically used for height. If you want to scale your vertical dimensions but don't care about the aspect ratio then use this.
// 3. Moderate Scale is the best one to use for font sizes, margins, paddings etc. This has a scale factor that you can vary if is not adjusted according to design
